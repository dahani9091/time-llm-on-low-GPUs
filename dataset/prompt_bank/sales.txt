Sales is a dataset that tracks the sales of products over time. Each row in this dataset provides information on the sales for a specific product during a specific week. The dataset includes the following columns: a unique product identifier (ean), the number of units sold (sold_units), the date (date), whether the product was on promotion (is_promo), the week number (week), the year (year), a category for the product (sub_axis), the final selling price after any discounts (Filled_Final_ISP), a seasonality index indicating how seasonal factors affect the product's sales (seasonality_index), and the discount applied to the product's price (discount). This dataset could be used to analyze sales trends, the impact of promotions, seasonal variations in sales, and the effectiveness of pricing strategies.
